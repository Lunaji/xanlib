# xanlib
xanlib is a Python library designed for working with the 3D data formats of the Xanadu engine, used in the game *Emperor: Battle for Dune game*.

Currently it can load and save back byte for byte all 1521 XBF files from the game, although 57 of them do not load fully.  
A very rudimentary vertex animation viewer made with `pygame` serves as an example of its usage.
